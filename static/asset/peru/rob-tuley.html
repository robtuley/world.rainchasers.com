<h1>Kayaking In Peru</h1>

<p>Peru is a beautiful place: safe and stable with some good paddling. Quite different paddling from the UK, it usually
   takes you as long to get to the river as to actually paddle it. The river character is siphon-y: instead of the
   river carving down into the rock and making rapids, massive boulders tend to fall in from the sides... But don't let
   this put you off! However, I cannot really stress enough how quickly these rivers change in character, usually from
   year to year. The information on this page is from Sept 2003, it would be wise to check with the local rafting
   outfits and kayakers if possible for more up to date info.</p>

<h2 id="rivers">Rivers</h2>

<p>Logistics is a major issue. Can often hook up with raft companies for lifts to and from the main runs, and sometimes
   even get paid for a spot of safety-boating, but otherwise its a battle with a series of buses/collectivos. Paddlers
   tend to base themelves in one of the three main tourist centres: Lima, Cusco or Arequipa.</p>

<p>
Getting on and off the river is a mini expedition by itself. Starting 
from Arequipa the first step is to get to Huambo, the nearest village to
 the put in. This is approximately a 5hr straight drive if you hire a 
van and driver, or the overnight bus is a much cheaper alternative. At 
Huambo there is a small hostel to stay the night and the lady at the 
tiny local shop is more than happy to serve some food. Need to set off 
early morning (7am-ish) to undertake the 8hr walk in from Huambo to the 
river at Canco. You'll need donkeys to carry your boat, food, etc. which
 are best organised in advance - we got them sorted out through Gian 
Marco Vellutino who is based at the Cusipata rafting company in 
Arequipa. The trek in is beautiful, and a little scary as you have to 
pick your way across some really steep scree slopes, and I recommend 
making sure your helmet is easily accessible when you pack the donkeys 
(we got caught in a mini-landslide). There is a beach by the river at 
Canco where you can camp the night.
</p>
<p>
At the get on at Canco the river is small volume and fairly dirty and 
the first 4km are grade II/III before a tributary joins from river right
 doubling the volume. The difference in water quality is very obvious. A
 few km downstream of the confluence the river picks its way through a 
fairly recent landslide. When we were there these rapids were a fairly 
pushy class IV+ with some bank scouting needed. At higher levels I can 
imagine these rapids getting harder, but scouting and portaging would be
 possible. These form probably the hardest rapids on the run and the 
main difficulties last for possibly a km or so.
</p>
<p>
Once past the landslide the river drops to its normal III/IV grade. The 
next obvious landmark is about 8km downstream - 'Ducha Del Condor' is 
marked by a small stream that shoots out of the cliff high up on river 
left and the water becomes a cloud of mist before it reaches the river. 
Directly opposite on river right is a rock shelf which is a good place 
to stop and spot condors. We saw two circling around. Another 8km of 
III/IV water downstream marks the start of Chocolate Canyon. The canyon 
itself lasts for approx 7km and the scenery is fantastic, with the shear
 walls a kaliescope of browns. The rapids within the canyon remain a 
mixture of grade III &amp; IV and there are several good places to camp 
by the river.
</p>
<p>
At the end of chocolate canyon is the first of the two portages Reparaz.
 This is a sieve-like true grade VI as none of the channels are really 
wide enough for a boat. Reparaz can be recognised from the river as a 
large triangular shape rock is situated mid-stream with a cushion wave 
leading into two small channels left and right. The portage is possible 
on river left where it you can eddy out at the start of a small stony 
beach. Its not an easy portage. Following Reparaz is the 4km long Green 
Canyon where the barren landscape is broken up by a few green trees 
&amp; bushes. No problems here as the water drops to a mellow grade III.
 Halfway down the canyon is a beach on the left and with plenty of 
driftwood and caves into the cliff which makes a very good camping spot.
 After Green canyon is Poles canyon where the rapids pick up slightly 
before reaching the final portage. It is possible to get out either 
river right or left, but the portage must be made on river right and 
requires ropes and a bit of boat hauling. The rapid itself possibly 
deserves a V+ grading - a line exists the consequences of a screw up are
 pretty severe. We portaged the bulk of the rapid and paddled only the 
final smaller slot and drop. After this portage the power of the river 
backs off and the canyon begins to open out.
</p>
<p>
After 70km of river, the canyon visibly opens out and a dirt track drops
 down to river level on the river right. Get out here and catch a 
collectivo for about an hour (in the downstream direction) to the town 
of Aplao. From here there are several buses back to Arequipa (approx 
4hrs I think). We got off the river at about 12, and made it back to 
arequipa late evening.
</p>

<h3 id="cotahuasi">Cotahuasi (Gd 4/5, 90km)</h3>

<p>
I don't have much info on this run, as I arrived out in Peru just after 
my buddies paddled it. By their account however, this river is a gem: it
 lies in the deepest canyon in the world (over 1800m deeper than the 
Grand Canyon) and contains some great whitewater. The usually paddled 
section can be divided up into two bits: the first 10km of quality class
 4(4+), and the remaining 80 or so km of continuous 3(4) are divided by a
 significant obstacle known as Sipia falls. Sipia is a huge waterfall 
that has cut its way into the valley as the river plunges 150m in height
 over three tiers. My buddies paddled the top few km of the section 
above the falls, got off the river in plenty of time, and met 
pre-arranged donkey transport to help with the monster six hour portage 
around the falls.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!
</p>

<h3 id="chili">Chili (Gd 3(4), 7km)</h3>

<p>
This is a commercially rafted section and can be done as a day trip out 
of Arequipa. To get to the get-in/out, best bet is to try to hook up 
with a rafting company in Arequipa. We went with Gian Marco at Cusipata 
Rafting. The river is not too far from Arequipa - put in just below a 
power station and paddle down until a approx 2m weir (runnable), where 
you get out to a track on river right. Hold on tight for the lift back 
from here to the main road...
</p>

<h3 id="apurimac">Apurimac (Commercial section, Gd 4(5), 50km)</h3>

<p>
It is easiest to go with rafting companies for this run, and if you want
 you can probably get paid to do some safety boating. The raftings 
season runs from April to Nov with high water at either end of the 
season. In high water apparently very good run. We paddled at approx 
20-30 cumecs flow at the lower end of the flow scale. We hooked up with 
Chando at Mayuc Rafting (good reliable company who run lots of trips, 
but mostly with Israeli punters so a knowledge of Hebrew is helpful, and
 if you don't enjoy singing round a log fire you're buggered), and Willi
 at Southern Rivers (not as busy as Mayuc but run trips for mostly 
English/Aussie punters).
</p>
<p>
The get in is a 4hr bus ride from Cusco along a mainly dirt track with a
 sheer drop on one side. Not for the faint hearted. The road comes down 
to a bridge over the river where you get on. The get out is the next 
road 50km downriver, and then its a 2hr ride back to Cusco.
</p>
<p>
About an hours worth of grade III leads up to the first drop, ominously 
called the 'the portage' by the raft guides. In low levels the drop 
itself looks easily runnable grade IV water but the hugh siphon river 
left halfway down the rapid discouraged us enough to follow the rafts on
 a portage on river left. We got back on the river in a large eddy just 
above the siphon, ferried across the top of it and ran the second half 
of the rapid. Mayuc camp on a beach just after this rapid.
</p>
<p>
The next rapid, Space Odyssey, is straight after the portage and is a 
fairly simple grade III/IV eddy hop affair, although by virtue of a 
swimming rafter disappearing under the big rock in the middle, the 
rafting punters walk round river left while the guides paddle the rafts 
down. More grade III leads down to where the rafters get out for a 10ft 
rock jump.
</p>
<p>
The next main rapid is Purgatory. At low flows this has quite a steep 
lead-in and then you can eddy out river right to have a look at the 
'harder' bit of the rapid. A big boulder that has split into two sits in
 the middle of the river. The channel far river left paddled fine at low
 levels, but was fairly tight and I imagine become more retentive in 
higher flows. The 'crack' flowing between the two split halves of the 
boulder is even tighter, literally a boat width, and has a munchy 
looking stopper at the entrance. Safety not easy either. Still, 
apparently they used to 'body-raft' (swim) this with all the rafters so 
it can't be that bad. Purgatory is the second raft portage, with the 
empty rafts squeezed sideways down the left channel.
</p>
<p>
The river continues on its III way until the next names rapid Zambezeta 
('mini-Zambezi'). Big waves and holes, but not really a problem to run 
blind and avoid on the way down. After this comes Trencher - again not a
 problem to run blind it has a sizeable pourover river rightish and a 
small siphon on the far right at the bottom. The final named rapid on 
the second day on the river is Batcave, although this does have a really
 good beach for camping just above it. Batcave itself is an easily run 
set of waves and holes, but can't be mistaken due to a great playwave on
 river left at the bottom with an enormous eddy river right. Mayuc tend 
to camp 10 mins beyond Batcave at 'La Mesa' although I think Southern 
Rivers camp just above it.
</p>
<p>
The 3rd day on the river brings Manwella ("toothache") so named due to 
the uncanny resemblance of a rock in the middle of the rapid to a 
molar... This is technically the hardest rapid on the run at grade V. It
 is possible to get out and inspect river left. At the low level when we
 were there there's a line down left or right of the 'tooth', but its 
fairly serious due to a big siphon river left behind the large eddy in 
the middle of the rapid. We ran both lines fine. Rafting punters are 
told to walk, but the raft guides usually padle the rafts down.
</p>
<p>
The rapid after Manwella is "You First": there's a sneaky kayak line 
river right with a 1m boof through a small slot, or a larger more 
interesting line river left of the large central boulder. Again, 
swimming rafters have been sucked into the green room, so punters walk, 
raft guides run. Not long after is Babalooba - rocky for the first half 
then a big wave train to finish. Straight after is 'Last Laugh', a very 
photogenic two tier drop run down the channel river right. From here its
 about 1hr mellow paddling to the take out where a road comes in on 
river right. Then back to watch the video in Mama Africa!
</p>
<p>
Above this commercial section is apparently another great grade IV two 
or three day trip, which can be paddled right down to the commercial 
put-in. Below the commercial section lurks the Abacomba Abyss, a section
 of hard grade V/V+.
</p>

<h3 id="urubamba">Urubamba (Gd 4/5, 12km)</h3>

<p>
It is a bit tricky to get to the put-in but well worth the effort. The 
river runs alongside part of the railway track from Cusco to Aguas 
Calientes, and thus position down the river can be judged by the railway
 'km' posts. Aguas Calientes is a small very touristy town only 
reachable by train that is a base to catch a bus up to Machu Picchu - 
very famous inca ruins. The section described here is from Chilca (km 
76.8) to km 88. Chilca is about 2hrs from Cusco ($20 in a taxi, or bus 
to Ollantaytambo and then combi or something the last 7km to Chilca), 
and has only one, unfortunately expensive, place to stay - Nustayoc 
Lodge @ $15 a night. Very nice though and off season as it was, the 
owner, an english speaking architect from Lima, even sat and had dinner 
with us... From the Lodge it is possible to walk 2 mins to the river.
</p>
<p>
The get-out is at km 88. This is a train stop with shop and generally 
people around. The local kids might want to play with your boats, but 
you can catch a train either way (back upstream or downstream to Agues 
Calientes). We caught the 8.30pm train to Agues Calientes and made a 
bee-line for the hot springs.
</p>
<p>
We paddled this river at at low level (approx 15-20 cumecs) in Sept and I
 imagine this run gets pretty mental when the water is higher.Km 76 
(Chilca) to km 79 is a nice easy grade 3 intro to the run. At precisely 
the km 79 post the river visibly steepens for the next km. Several hard 
pushy rapids, mostly 4+. Awesome section. Km 82 is one of the starting 
points for the Inca Trail, and a train stop is visible on river right. 
More obvious perhaps is the bridge over the river. About 30m beyond the 
bridge on a left hand bend is a nasty grade V river-wide pourover. Can 
inspect (and portage like we did) on river left.
</p>
<p>
The river then carries on at fast and hard grade IV up to about km 83, 
where the river mellows fractionally and becomes a little less pushy, 
finally with some braething space between rapids. Don't let this deceive
 you however, as at about Km 84.5 there is another grade V rapid where 
all the water pours down a slot straight into a large boulder. Inspect 
(and portage?) river left. Km 85-86 is a long river km as the river 
meanders in a large U shape away from the railway. Towards the end of 
this section is a riverwide IV+ pourover.
</p>
<p>
Just over a km later just before km 87, two massive boulders on river 
left mark the beginning of a grade V/VI canyon. The easiest way to 
portage this is to break out river right, carry up to the railway 
tracks. Portage down the tracks past the km 87 post and through a 
tunnel. 1 km walk gets you to a small path back down to the river. From 
here the last 1/2 km to the get out at km 88 is grade 4-ish. When you 
see a big scree slope river right, hop out and carry up to catch the 
train.
</p>
<p>
A little way below km 88 the river is dammed and most of the water is 
taken out and pumped down beyond Machu Picchu. There is a radical 
looking section in Agues Calientes town itself, although you would need 
more volume that when we were there. The section below this looks pretty
 hard too... This lower section of the river can be scouted by 
continuing to walk down the railway tracks from Agues Calientes. Mandor 
waterfall (not really kayakable) is down here too, although in higher 
water the creek might be good. There are also apparently waterfalls on 
the tributary above the hot springs at the top of Agues Calientes.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="lunahuana">Lunahuana (Gd 4/4+, 30km)</h3>

<p>
The Lunahuana flows down into San Vicente de Cañete, just south down the
 coast from Lima. Get off the bus at Cañete, and make you way 
(taxi/combi) to Imperial which is just on the outskirts. From here it is
 possible to get a local bus or combi (about 3 hours) up the river. The 
river section described here is 30km long - get-on at Catahuasi and 
take-out at Pacaran. There are various ways of doing shuttle - we caught
 a combi up the river from Imperial to Pacaran and stayed in a hostel 
there for the night, in morning left our stuff in the hostel and caught a
 bus up the river and paddled down in the afternoon, staying at Pacaran 
again in the evening. Be warned though, it takes longer than you think 
to get around - after we stayed in Pacaran we got up really early the 
next day and were out trying to hitch a lift up river at 6.30am. Caught a
 combi at 8am halfway there and although we tried to bargain they 
wouldn't take us the rest of the way. Ended up catching the local bus 
that left Pacaran at 10.30am and got into Catahuasi about 12...
</p>
<p>
In Catahuasi walk upstream past the police station and you can get down 
to the river just past the school. The get-out at Pacaran is obvious and
 is marked by a large red iron bridge. The first km out from Catahuasi 
is explosive, rocky, and very steep but due to the low volume most of it
 can be run blind, with only a couple of rapids we jumped out to have a 
look at. After this the river mellows a little, but the gradient is 
pretty unrelenting.
</p>
<p>
A little way down you pass under the bridge high above that takes the 
road from river-left to river-right. A little further on and the river 
steepens perceptably again as it passes under a footbridge. My memory 
gets a little blurred after this (we were paddling fast to make it down 
before dark), but I think the river mellows a little before entering a 
small canyon, and finally a white cross becomes visible in the mountains
 ahead. Beneath the cross is Pacaran, with the get-out from the river 
obvious due to the whopping red iron bridge. All-in-all we managed to 
paddle the 30km in just over 5hrs, without even the consideration of a 
portage. Magic. Don't forget to visit the 'Pisco' distillery in Pacaran 
after the run either!
</p>

<h3 id="surf">Surf</h3>

<p>
There is some great surfing in Peru. Can go either in Lima, which has 
some really nice clean breaks, or we found a lovely spot at Punta 
Hermosa, about 40 mins south of Lima along the coastal road. Can jump 
off the bus on the main road and simply walk 15-20mins down to the 
beach, or a taxi is easier on the shoulders. A variety of waves to chose
 from, including 'Pico Alto'. 'Alto' sounded too ominous for me and I 
was happy with massive unintentional aerial bounces off the 'smaller' 
waves.
</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<h3>How to get there</h3>

<p>From the UK its a case of flying with your boat. Three of us flew out in Aug/Sept 2003, one with BA and two with Iberia.
   BA were, as usual, brilliant with boats but Iberia gave us some grief, although they did upgrade both of us to business
   class on the way home. Cost of flights were approx £800 each, although we were flying peak tourist season.</p>

<h3>When to go</h3>

<p>The season is virtually all year round, and it depends how scared you want to be as to when you go. The rains come in
   Oct/Nov and last to about March, and the water gets gradually lower and lower from then on during the year. We went in Sept,
   when the water was almost at its lowest, but if we were to go back I think we'd be tempted to go a bit earlier.</p>

<h3>Getting Around</h3>

<p>You'll spent a lot of time in Peru simply getting from place to place but I was surprised at how easy it was to get
   the kayaks around with you. Peru is undoubtably a big place, and flying is the fastest option and fairly cheap. Local
   airlines like Lan Chile and Lan Peru fly regularly from Lima to Cusco or Arequipa. A good alternative for long trips
   are the overnight buses - these are very cheap (even with the extra bribe to get the kayaks in the hold) and actually
   quite comfortable, often with a english film subtitled in spainish to keep you occupied. For shorter hops you can
   grab a local bus (kayak on roofrack/hold), taxi with roofrack (negotiate a fare before you get in!) or a collectivo
   (which is basically a small minivan that acts as a shared taxi). The collectivos are great, the record we had while
   out there was 29 people crammed into what is basically a Toyota HiAce van.</p>

<h3>Weather</h3>

<p>Obviously depends on what time of year you're out there, but basically pretty mild. In September when we were out it
   was sunny nearly every day and rained only twice. However, you're often at quite a high altitude (e.g. Cusco = 3500m alt.)
   so don't make my mistake and just bring out a thin sleeping bag and one fleece. You'll need warm stuff.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>Hostels, hostels and more hostels. They are everywhere, and at what is the equivilent of about £2 a night, they're bargain.
   I'm sure that there are plenty of nicer and more expensive options, but financially broken after paying for our flights
   hostels are all we tried.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>The cost of living while you're out there is very cheap. I went for a month and spent £800 on flights and £350 while I was
   there, and there was a lot of eating out in cafe/restaurant for breakfast and dinner, huge amounts of travelling
   around, etc. The peruvian currency is the Sol, but if you're going to take any cash or travellers cheques get them all
   in dollars, the 'unofficial' currency. Can just take a visa card and find a cash machine in most main centres.</p>
