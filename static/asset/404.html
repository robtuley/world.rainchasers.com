<h1>Ooops, Not Found!</h1> 
<p>Sorry, but we can't find the page you've asked for. It's a simple 
   site so best bet is <a href=/>to start at the homepage</a> to look for what you're 
   after.</p>

<!--
This is a short and sweet custom 404 page that uses Google's
404 widget. The page is so short and sweet that to ensure that
it works in IE we need a bit of an HTML comment at the end to
fool IE that the page is long enough to be useful.
