Kayaking in Kyrgyzstan
======================

A logistically challenging country that harbours some good paddling adventures where half the battle is actually getting to the river.

When to go
----------

July and August are the hottest months, and due to the glacier coverage they are also the time of year when rivers are at their highest. Depending on what water levels you want, the paddling season runs from late June (very high) to mid-September (dropping off).

How to get there
----------------

It is possible to fly into either Bishkek (Kyrgyz capital) or Almaty (in Kazakstan, but very close to the border), and BA fly direct to both from London Heathrow. A cheaper option is to fly via Moscow, with Aeroflot being the major carrier on this route.

Travelling around
-----------------

We didn't experiment with local public transport, but I think it would be a real struggle. Couple that with the fact that most rivers are in very sparsely populated areas and I think it would be virtually impossible. Most of the Russians who paddle this region drive a car down themselves. If you're flying in, it's probably best to hire a vehicle and a driver. For a small group, a 4x4 (usually a Lada Niva) would be ideal.

Language
--------

The local language is Kyrgyz which is very similar to Russian. It is worth remembering that if you hire a driver, they will often be Russian, and communication may be a problem. Don't expect anyone local to speak English, they won't.

Weather
-------

Is reasonably mild. The paddling season is the Kyrgyz summer, so during the day the sun's generally shining (although expect some rain), and temperature pleasant. You will need to pack warm gear, and a good snug sleeping bag. Many rivers are at high altitude, and you will probably spend most time between 1500-3000m altitude: during the night it will often drop below freezing.

Accommodation
-------------

We camped out the back of the trucks for most of the trip, and I recommend you at least take camping gear. In the larger centres there are plenty of hostels, but you are unlikely to spend much time actaully in the main towns if you want to be paddling.

Money
-----

Although there are ATM machines in Bishkek (which take both Visa and Maestro), you'll rarely find them outside major cities. Travellers cheques are a real no-go too - you will only be able to change them at the banks in Bishkek, and they charge an 'admin' commission. Dollars cash is probably your best bet - there are currency exchange booths all over the place. Large denomination notes will get the best exchange rates, and make sure your notes are printed recently and in good condition - they wouldn't accept notes older than 1994 when we were there, and certainly not torn or marked notes.
