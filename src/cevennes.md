Cévennes (South France)
=======================

The Cévennes is a range of mountains in southern France (just north of Montpellier) with good low-volume steep creeking. As with most European destinations the infrastructure is excellent and all rivers can be accessed easily by road and paddled as day-runs.

When to go
----------

The rivers are rain-fed so good water levels are unpredictable. The best chance of good levels is in the spring (April-May) or autumn (Oct-Nov): the latter being the most reliable. Depending on rainfall the rivers may come up at other periods but it is unwise to plan a trip in advance outside spring/autumn. 

How to get there
----------------

Various airports surround the region: Montpellier, Nîmes, Montèlimar etc depending on where you are flying from.

Transport
---------

Public transport is not possible, you will need your own vehicle. There is good road access to all the runs and shuttles are generally short: it would be easy to shuttle by hitching/bike or even on foot.
