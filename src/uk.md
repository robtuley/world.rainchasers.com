When to go
----------

Rivers are rain-fed, with the best chance of good levels between Oct-April. Over Dec/Jan the rain can fall as snow, especially in Scotland, and the weather is cold so Spring/Autumn are probably a better bet. 

How to get there
----------------

For Wales, fly into Bristol, Cardiff, Manchester or Liverpool. For Scotland fly into Glasgow or Edinburgh. If you're coming to Devon, London is a short drive away.

Transport
---------

You will need your own vehicle, it is easy to hire but bring your own roofrack setup.

Accommodation
-------------

Wild camping is difficult, but plenty of official campsites. A better alternative given the cold wet weather would be a B&B, YHA youth hostel or rented apartment/bunkhouse.
