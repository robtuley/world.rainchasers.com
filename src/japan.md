Japan
=====

Maybe doesn't have the paddling quality for those on a paddling-only-mission, but is a interesting destination culturally. Rivers are generally short and pool-drop, with a high proportion of dam-release runs. Dave Goadby characterised the rivers as concrete, "even down in the bottom of deep gorges there's pipework and construction stuff".
