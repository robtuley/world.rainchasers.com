British Columbia, Canada
========================

A paddling destination where you can squeeze in a lot of high quality runs in a short period of time. The road infrastructure is excellent especially as logging companies have opened tracks to many of the remoter areas and with plenty of moderate to difficult single-day runs.

When to go
----------

?? Summer?

How to get there
----------------

It is easiest to fly into Vancouver and head north from there.

Transport
---------

Public transport is not a realistic option, so you will need your own vehicle. The shuttles in general are short and fast so not real need for a dedicated driver. 4x4 would be useful in some places, but you can do without if you're on a tight budget. 

Accommodation
-------------

Plenty of motels/official campsites and it wouldn't be too hard to find places to wild camp if desired.
