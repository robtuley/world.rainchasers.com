British Columbia, Canada
========================

A classic creek boating paradise with big mountains, huge snowfall and great rivers which flow long into the summer. The road infrastructure is excellent especially as logging companies have opened tracks to many of the remoter areas and with plenty of moderate to difficult day-runs.

When to go
----------

June to August is ideal; May and September are possible.

How to get there
----------------

It is easiest to fly into Vancouver and head north from there.

Transport
---------

Public transport is not a realistic option, so you will need your own vehicle. The shuttles in general are short and fast so not real need for a dedicated driver. 4x4 would be useful in some places, but you can do without if you're on a tight budget. 

Accommodation
-------------

Plenty of motels/official campsites and it wouldn't be too hard to find places to wild camp if desired.
