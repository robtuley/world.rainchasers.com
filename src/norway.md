Norway
======

Superb medium volume creeking day-runs of moderate to very hard difficultly. Lots of waterfalls, and most runs have easy road access.

  * "Norway: The Whitewater Guide" by Jens Klatt and Olaf Obsommer, ISBN 3-9809315-4-4. An excellent up-to-date guide in both English and German. 

When to go
----------

The rivers are fed by snowmelt from mid-May to Aug, although some rivers remain possible until Sept. The melt starts earlier in the southern areas, so if you have the time you can start in the south at the end of May and drive north to follow the meltwater. 

How to get there
----------------

The easiest airport close to good paddling is Oslo. Everything is relatively expensive in Norway, so Europeans will often choose to drive instead of fly to avoid high hire car costs (and it means you can bring your own cheaper food/booze).

Transport
---------

Public transport is not possible: you will need your own vehicle. If flying into Oslo [Rent-A-Wreck](http://www.rent-a-wreck.no) are the cheapest hire cars, and roofracks are usually available due to the amount of ski tourism. Typical shuttles are along good quality but empty roads: it would be slow to hitch although cycling is possible. The country is a popular paddling destination so if you do have only one vehicle it will not be hard to share shuttles with other groups.

Language
--------

Norwegian is a hard language to master, but English is widely spoken.

Weather
-------

The season is the Norwegian summer: the temperature is mild rather than hot, and there might be a few rain showers. It remains light well into the late evening and it will be possible to jump on for a quick run at midnight: you'll run out of energy rather than light.

Accommodation
-------------

It is easy and mild enough to camp, and you have a legal right to wild camp anywhere that is not within sight of houses or holiday homes. Plenty of other accomodation is available but not casually: you will usually need to book in advance.
