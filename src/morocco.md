Morocco (High Atlas)
====================

Good variety of easy to moderate difficulty runs from single to multi-day in the High Atlas mountain range. Road infrastructure is reasonable, and flights from Europe are relatively cheap.

When to go
----------

Rivers are snow and rain fed and the best chance of good levels is April-May. 

How to get there
----------------

Plenty of cheap flights are available into Marrakesh which is worth exploring during your trip. Although there are a few local rivers, the bulk of the Atlas mountain range is about a day's drive. An alternative if you were aiming for the more northern runs would be to fly directly to Fez instead.

Transport
---------

Public transport might be possible but very slow. You really need your own vehicle and a dedicated driver since a lot of the shuttles would be infeasible to fit into the same day as the paddle. The road infrastructure is reasonable and you can get by without a 4x4 quite easily. 

Language
--------

Outside the main cities English is unlikely to be understood, instead French is widely spoken alongside Arabic. If you hire a local driver it is essential to have at least a rudimentary understanding of French. 

Weather
-------

At easter the weather should be sunny but not too hot, and you'll probably get a few downpours.

Accommodation
-------------

Wild camping is easy anywhere, and the main paddling areas are well populated with plenty of cheap clean hotels.

Money
-----

In larger towns there are ATMs that will accept Visa, although expect some bank network problems preventing you from reliably getting at your cash (make sure you keep a cash buffer with you!).
