Putorana Plateau (Northern Siberia)
===================================

The Putorana Plateau mountain range is at the very north of Siberia. It is a trip for serious expedition waterfall hunters only: a helicopter is required to access the area, and the rivers are generally flat with sporadic waterfalls.

When to go
----------

Second half of July: early July is possible but the water levels will be high, in early August you run the risk of the rivers being too low.

How to get there
----------------

Fly into Norilsk. The city is unpleasant but the closest you can get before switching to helicopter to gain access to the region.

Weather
-------

Well into the Arctic Circle, the snow and ice remains till late June. Summer is short and unpredictable, it could be hot and sunny, or snowing! Pack to cope with anything.
