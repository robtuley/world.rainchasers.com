When to go
----------

Rivers levels are good between June to December, during the wet season. Peaks rainfall is in June and October.

How to get there
----------------

Fly to San Jose.

Transport
---------

You can either source your own vehicle, or use taxis/cattle trucks/minibuses. The main paddling areas are not far from San Jose, but road quality is poor. If you don't fly with your kayaks, you can hire from Turrialba but the choice is limited.

Weather
-------

Expect temperatures from 22ᵒC inland in the hills at San Jose to 30ᵒC+ on the coast: sunshine in the mornings and rain from mid-afternoon onwards.
