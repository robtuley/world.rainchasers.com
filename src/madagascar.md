Kayaking in Madagascar
======================

An unusual destination with tricky logistics.

When to go
----------

It is posible to kayak something all year. The larger rivers are too dangerous in the rainy season (Jan-Mar), but the creeking is best from Jan to May. The eastern rivers run from May to December. The April-May period is recommended as some tracks start drying out (making logistics easier) yet most rivers still have high levels.
