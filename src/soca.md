When to go
----------

Cool spring conditions from Mid-March to April, possible but usually low levels. Ideal season is May/June: warmer days and higher water with the peak runoff of snow melt in late May. Still possible in July & August, hot days but levels will be dropping off. 

How to get there
----------------

Europeans will often choose to drive. By air, cheap flights into Trieste (Italy) and drive the hire car into Slovenia.

Transport
---------

You will need your own vehicle, but shuttles are short and easy to hitch/cycle. The area is very popular, especially with German boaters, so it should be easy to share shuttles.

Accommodation
-------------

Wild camping would be difficult as this is a popular and busy area, but there is a good campsites at Bovec and plenty of hotels/apartments along the length of the Soča.
