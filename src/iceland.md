When to go
----------

Most of the snow-melt runs will go from May to late June depending on the snow pack. All of the main glacial runs will be low in May/June then once the warm weather hits they will rise. All you need are a few days of a southerly weather system to bring them up. September can be a good month as the autumn storms bring the last of the warm air to push the rivers up for one last blast. 

How to get there
----------------

Flights into Rekjavik, reasonable from UK with Easyjet.

Transport
---------

Public transport will be hopeless, is easy to hire 4x4.
