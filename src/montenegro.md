When to go
----------

The best season is May-June, although some of the larger rivers will continue to run till Sept. River levels are highest in April, but it will be freezing cold so it is not recommended to go that early unless you need high levels to paddle the smaller tribs.

How to get there
----------------

Fly into the capital Podgorica.

Transport
---------

You will need your own transport, road access is OK but road quality is poor.
