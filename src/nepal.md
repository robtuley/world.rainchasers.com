When to go
----------

The monsoon runs from June to Sept: From Aug-Sept the levels will be very high and most rivers will be a little sketchy. The best time to catch the rivers is just after this from Oct-Nov where the levels are good and temperatures warm. Plenty of groups come out in Dec often over xmas: it will be colder but the low water levels are good for certain runs. The levels remain reliably low but paddleable from late Feb to early May and this period will be warmer than xmas.

How to get there
----------------

Fly into Katmandu, often via Delhi. Oct-Nov is the peak tourist season so if that's when you intend to visit book your flights well in advance. 

Transport
---------

Nepal has a cheap and frequent bus service that is happy to carry kayaks (on the roof; beware jagged roofrack edges holing your boat before you get to the river). Taxis or private minibuses for hire are cheap and plenty have roofracks, and even those that don't will often happily carry your boat on the roof.

Language
--------

English is widely spoken.
