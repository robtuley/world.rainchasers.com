When to go
----------

The monsoon runs from June to Sept: During Jul-Aug the levels will be very high and most of the normal rivers will be way too high to paddle. The best time to catch the majority of the classics is just after this from Oct-Nov where the levels are good and temperatures warm. September is better for the longer flatter runs (like the Sun-Kosi) as there's less flat water slogging, whilst levels (and temperatures) have dropped off by December but the low water levels mean you can get in higher up than the normal put-ins of some of the classic runs. An alternative (quieter) season runs from late Feb to early May as the temperatures are warming up and levels slowly rising back to their epic summer levels.

How to get there
----------------

Fly into Katmandu, often via Delhi. Oct-Nov is the peak tourist season so if that's when you intend to visit book your flights well in advance. 

Transport
---------

Nepal has a cheap and frequent bus service that is happy to carry kayaks (on the roof; beware jagged roofrack edges holing your boat before you get to the river). Taxis or private minibuses for hire are cheap and plenty have roofracks, and even those that don't will often happily carry your boat on the roof.

Language
--------

English is widely spoken.
