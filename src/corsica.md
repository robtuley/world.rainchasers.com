Corsica
=======

Excellent low-volume steep creeking, but with a short season that can be difficult to catch.

When to go
----------

The snow and rain-fed driven season is over April, but it is unreliable and you are not guaranteed to have good levels.  

How to get there
----------------

Usual route is not to fly to Corsica directly but either to:
  
  * Fly into Sardinia (Alghero airport) and then catch the short ferry across to Corsica
  * Fly into Italy and then catch the ferry across. This has the advantage that if Corsica has no water you can make alternative plans to paddle in Italy instead.

Transport
---------

You will need your own vehicle. Because of the short season kayakers all visit the area at the same time so it should be possible to hook up with other groups for shuttles. The road infrastructure is good, but it is slow going anywhere other than round the coast. Runs are all single-day most with direct road access; shuttles usually short and could be done by bike. 

Accommodation
-------------

Wild camping is possible, and there are plenty of official campsites/hotels/apartments to hire.
