When to go
----------

The rivers are fed by snowmelt which occurs from April to May/June. The thaw starts earlier in Spain (mid-April to the start of June depending the snowpack) than in France (mid-May to the end of June). 

How to get there
----------------

Cheap flights into Carcasonne. Europeans will often choose to drive.

Transport
---------

You will need your own vehicle, but shuttles are short and direct and would be possible to hitch/cycle. It is a popular kayaking destination so it may be possible to hook up with other groups to share the shuttle. Longer runs like the Noguera Pallaresa run along a main road making it easy to hitch.

Accommodation
-------------

Wild camping would be difficult but there are good clean official camping grounds near most areas. There are plenty of hostels/hotels in both Spain and France, or hire an apartment at one of ski resorts which because it is in the off-season can be very cheap.
